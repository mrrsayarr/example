When will my angel come?
My breathing's coming so much harder
I think it's time for me to slip away
My soul is coming out my body
And darkness finds my eyes
But then your voice calls me back to light.
Chorus:
When my heart is gone
And my life means naught
And it's just an endless darkness that I trod
I have you
and that soothes my very soul
When I cannot live
And I'm too weak to go on
And there's nothing more that I feel I can do
I have you with me
And that's all I'll ever want
Verse 2:
Your hand is reaching out to catch me
To pull me up from this sea I'm drowning in
And now you put your arms around me
Which causes me to smile =)
Cause when the final blow was coming
You shielded me, you brought me back to health
And when I thought my story'd ended
You came and turned the page
And I am sure that I'll remember
(repeat C)
Shelter me with your wings
So I don't have to fear anything
(4 measures rest-awesome orchestral part =))
You'll never know how much you mean to me, baby.
You gave me love; that's all that I'll ever need
When tears are falling down my face,
you make it better when you hold me
You are my angel
(repeat C 2x)
I have you with me
And that's all I'll ever want
I have you
And that soothes my very soul
When I cannot live
And I'm too weak to go on
And there's nothing more that I feel I can do
I have you with me
And that's all I'll ever want...yeah.

Isn't is sad when an angel cries?
Small pearl drops fall from the skies,
holy water flows in tears,
human burdens their only fears.
They live among us everyday,
to help guide us on our way,
it upsets them to hear our lies,
Isn't it sad when an angel cries?
Everyday they absorb our pain,
in their tears it will remain,
we may ask what goods it for?
But everyday they are fighting our war.
Some battles won whilst others lost,
earth to be rebuilt at such a cost,
life streams are broken when they try,
isn't it sad for an angle to cry?

How sweet it were, if without feeble fright,
Or dying of the dreadful beauteous sight,
An angel came to us, and we could bear
To see him issue from the silent air
At evening in our room, and bend on ours
His divine eyes, and bring us from his bowers
News of dear friends, and children who have never
Been dead indeed,--as we shall know forever.
Alas! we think not what we daily see
About our hearths,--angels that are to be,
Or may be if they will, and we prepare
Their souls and ours to meet in happy air;--
A child, a friend, a wife whose soft heart sings
In unison with ours, breeding its future wings.

Maybe I have wings
That only need to stretch
For you to see them
The wings that you may see
Are not of the brightest white
But of black with hints of red
I’m not the fairy light of innocence
I don’t shine with unnatural brightness
My thoughts are not the purest
I’m an angel of a different kind
Not the one that sings glory in high or praises Halleluiah
You won’t meet me at St. Peters gates
I’m a dark sort of being
And I may not be the chosen guardian
But I will still guard from afar
Know that I will always be watching
And praying for your well being
And from me love will always be flowing
A dark angelic being
Misunderstood in living
An angel of a different kind

Angel angel, tell me true-
Is his heart as big and true
As his eyes make me believe?
Angel, angel, tell me please.
Angel, secret friends are rare;
Such kindly faces, liars wear-
But he's a different kind, I think-
Would he stay, if I should blink?
Angel angel, nights are long;
All for him, I'd write my songs;
Angel, whisper in his ear-
Tell him: 'Joy- when you are near.'

May angels always care for you,
May they keep you standing tall,
May they whisper in your ears words of wisdom,
May they show you what you need to know
May you always have an angel,
Sent by God to your side,
Someone there to catch you fast,
If sometimes you were to fall
May you have someone wonderful to love,
May angels teach you love untold,
May you have hopes to keep you safe and warm,
And give you all the gifts of love and life
May they keep their lights on you,
To guide every step of your way,
And keep you from each and all harm,
Each and every new day
May you always have an angel,
That speaks through your heart,
To help you pick up the pieces,
When everything for you goes bad

You never stand alone
When your guardian angel is always near,
During the moments of trials and tribulation,
You will never be overcome with fear.
His presence may not be seen,
Regardless of where you are,
Rest assured that his halo is always shining
Like the brightest, heavenly star.
You never stand alone,
When in your heart you know,
Your guardian angel is your protectorate,
Who hovers over you and loves you so.

I have fallen from sky,
Fallen to the ground,
I am the angel of sadness,
Angel of lost hopes,
Angel of lost dreams,
I am the fallen angel,
Fear me not,
I am here for reason,
That reason is to have a second chance in life,
That life I was given for a reason,
They took my wings,
They took me apart made me human,
I was the fallen angel,
But that fallen angel had one chance in life that she was given,
This angel won’t make the same mistakes she made before,
This angel will go down the right path that has been chosen for her,
This fallen angel know what she has to do to be forgiven.

When the night comes then your voice calm down
When the moon begin to sail in the sky
then your eyes are closing down to sleep
You fall asleep while dim light illuminates your room
I love to watch you sleep my little girl
You sleep like a little angel within your dreams
Your hair falls both sides of your face and
your hands  folded in to the blanket
Your pillows and bunnies are speard around you
You breath soft and low while your innocent heart
beat slowly to the merry tune
I love to watch you sleep my little baby
When I want to kiss you to say good night in your sleep
then you toss your head and stretch your little body
and turn around sleep again while holding your pillow
God brought you to me and given you as his gift
and today you are the greatest treasure in my life
Someone to laugh and dance and sing in my home
I love to watch you sleep my angel
